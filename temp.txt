// LOGIC

1. Fetch JSON from https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?pageSize=10&q=crypto&apiKey=cc5426462a664c0399c218ae0bdfd1b9 (10 tweets)
2. Extract url objects
3. Run prompt in chatGPT
4. Get JSON response from chatGPT
5. Loop through "generated_tweets.content"
6. Store each new tweet in a DB
7. Maintain a cursor
7. Run "tweeter" as a cron job. This will post a new tweet every 6 hours. 6 * 10 = 60 hours until completion
6. Once DB is exhausted (cursor position can no longer increment) go to step 1


// ERROR CASES TO BE HANDLED
• openAI 5xx
• chatGPT response JSON parsing error
• chatGPT responses are not consistent! Iterate one by one?
